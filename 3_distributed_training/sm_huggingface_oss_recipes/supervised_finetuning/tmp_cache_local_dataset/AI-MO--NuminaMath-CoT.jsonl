For any \\( n \\geq 2 \\), there exists a set \\( S \\) of \\( n \\) positive integers.\n2. Each pair of distinct elements \\( a, b \\) in this set satisfies the condition that \\( a - b \\) divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nBased on the USA TST 2015 problem, consider the specific construction: \n- Let \\( S = \\{ k, k(k + 1), k(k + 1)(k + 2), \\dots, k(k + 1)(k + 2) \\ldots (k + n - 1) \\} \\)\n- Here, \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nWe need to verify that for any distinct \\( a, b \\in S \\):\n- \\( (a - b)^2 \\) divides \\( ab \\).\n\nBy the construction, each element of the set \\( S \\) looks like a product of consecutive integers starting from \\( k \\). Thus, for any two distinct elements \\( a, b \\) in the set \\( S \\):\n\n- Let \\( a = k(k + 1)\\ldots(k + i) \\) and \\( b = k (k + 1)\\ldots (k + j) \\) where \\( i \\neq j \\).\n- Without loss of generality, suppose \\( i < j \\).

The more general problem states:\n\n> Prove that for every positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a set \\( S \\) of \\( n \\) positive integers such that for any two distinct \\( a, b \\in S \\), \\( a - b \\) divides \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) but not any other element of \\( S \\).\n\nTo utilize this theorem, let's recall the problem statement from the USA TST 2015:\n\n1. For any \\( n \\geq 2 \\), there exists a set \\( S \\) of \\( n \\) positive integers.\n2. Each pair of distinct elements \\( a, b \\) in this set satisfies the condition that \\( a - b \\) divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nBased on the USA TST 2015 problem, consider the specific construction: \n- Let \\( S = \\{ k, k(k + 1), k(k + 1)(k + 2), \\dots, k(k + 1)(k + 2) \\ldots (k + n - 1) \\} \\)\n- Here, \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nWe need to verify that for any distinct \\( a, b \\in S \\):\n- \\( (a - b)^2 \\) divides \\( ab \\).\n\nBy the construction, each element of the set \\( S \\) looks like a product of consecutive integers starting from \\( k \\). Thus, for any two distinct elements \\( a, b \\) in the set \\( S \\):\n\n- Let \\( a = k(k + 1)\\ldots(k + i) \\) and \\( b = k (k + 1)\\ldots (k + j) \\) where \\( i \\neq j \\).\n- Without loss of generality, suppose \\( i < j \\). So \\( b = a(k+i+1)(k+i+2)\\ldots(k+j) \\).\n\nThe difference \\( a - b \\) would involve subtracting two such products where one is a subset of the factors of the other.\n\nNow consider \\( (a - b)^2 \\):\n- Since \\( b \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b = a \\times (\\text{product of additional consecutive integers}) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( a - b \\) is \\( a \\) times (additional factors minus 1), ensuring \\( a - b \\) is symmetric in the factor \\( a \\).\n  \nThis symmetry ensures:\n- If \\( a - b \\) is significantly factored compared to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), then \\( (a - b)^2 \\) can fit as a divisor of the product \\( ab \\).\n\nThus, \\( (a-b)^2 \\) will divide \\( ab \\) by this careful selection and inherent symmetry their product restructuring provides.\n\nIn conclusion, by using the construction provided by USA TST 2015's criteria in the particular form of choosing elements that follow the first product of consecutive integers, we ensure that the set \\( S \\) satisfies the given condition for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{ }\\)","role":"assistant"}]}

From the problem statement, the strength coefficient \\( S_A \\) is calculated as the total points of players that \\( A \\) defeated minus the points of players to whom \\( A \\) lost.\n\n2. **Step 2: Total points summation:**\n    Summing the points of all participants, we consider that any point won by one participant is lost by the other, making the total sum zero. Thus,\n    \\[\n    \\sum P_A = 0\n    \\]\n    \n3. **Step 3: Sum of strength coefficients:**\n    Now we sum the strength coefficients over all participants:\n    \\[\n    \\sum S_A = \\sum (\\text{points of defeated opponents} - \\text{points of opponents who defeated them})\n    \\]\n    \n4. **Step 4: Cancellation property:**\n    Here, each participant's positive contribution from the point of view of one participant cancels another's negative contribution. Therefore,\n    \\[\n    \\sum S_A = 0\n    \\]\n    \n5. **Step 5: Implication:**\n    If every participant had a positive strength coefficient,\n    \\[\n    S_A > 0 \\quad \\forall A\n    \\]\n    Then,\n    \\[\n    \\sum S_A > 0\n    \\]\n    This contradicts our observation that \\( \\sum S_A \\) must be zero. Therefore, \n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt is impossible for all participants to have a positive strength coefficient.\n\n#### Part (b)\nNext, we check whether the strength coefficients of all participants can be less than 0.\n\n1. **Step 1: Assuming all strength coefficients are negative:**\n    We begin by assuming each participant \\( A \\) has a negative strength coefficient,\n    \\[\n    S_A < 0 \\quad \\forall A\n    \\]\n\n2. **Step 2: Sum of strength coefficients:**\n    From before, we know\n    \\[\n    \\sum S_A = 0\n    \\]\n    \n3. **Step 3: Negative Summation Implication:**\n    If all terms in the summation were strictly negative,\n    \\[\n    \\sum S_A < 0\n    \\]\n    This again contradicts the earlier result that \\( \\sum S_A = 0 \\). Hence, this assumption fails.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThus, it is impossible for all participants to have a negative strength coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{It is impossible for all participants to have either all positive or all negative strength coefficients.}}\n\\]\n\n\\tailsquare","role":"assistant"}]}

The law of conservation of momentum applies. Initially, the momentum of the system is the vertical momentum of the firecracker:\n   \\[\n   p_{\\text{initial}} = m \\cdot v_y = m \\cdot 10 \\ \\mathrm{m\/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Horizontal component of momentum after explosion:**\n   One of the fragments flies horizontally with a velocity of \\( v_{x1} = 48 \\ \\mathrm{m\/s} \\). The vertical component of its velocity remains the same at \\( v_{y1} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{m\/s} \\). Thus, the total velocity vector's magnitude for the first fragment is:\n   \\[\n   v_1 = \\sqrt{v_{x1}^2 + v_{y1}^2} = \\sqrt{48^2 + 10^2} \\ \\mathrm{m\/s} = \\sqrt{2304 + 100} \\ \\mathrm{m\/s} = \\sqrt{2404} \\ \\mathrm{m\/s} \\approx 49.03 \\ \\mathrm{m\/s}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Applying momentum conservation in vertical direction:**\n   Since the horizontal momentum of the system was initially zero, the total horizontal momentum of the system after the explosion must also be zero. Therefore, the velocity of the second fragment in the horizontal direction must be equal and opposite to the first fragment\u2019s horizontal velocity to conserve momentum:\n   \\[\n   m \\cdot v_{x1} + m \\cdot v_{x2} = 0 \\implies v_{x2} = -48 \\ \\mathrm{m\/s}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Applying momentum conservation in vertical direction:**\n   The vertical component of the momentum must remain conserved.

This transformation will allow us to think of any subsequence of consecutive children in a simpler, more mathematically tractable way.\n\n2. **Identify all possible groups of 30 consecutive children:**\n   We need to look at all possible groups of 30 consecutive children. We will call these groups \"units.\" Each unit contains 15 boys and 15 girls.\n\n3. **Utilize the given condition:**\n   According to the problem, there is exactly one unit of 30 consecutive children in which the number of boys is equal to the number of girls. This means we have a unit with 15 boys and 15 girls.\n\n4. **Derive properties of neighboring units:**\n   If we move from one unit to the next, replacing the first child of the previous unit with the next child in the circle, the number of boys can either stay the same, increase by 1, or decrease by 1.

We can choose \\(n = 1\\).\n\n   - **Case 2**: Exactly two of \\(a, b, c\\) are even.\n     - Without loss of generality, assume \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, and \\(c\\) is odd.\n     - Then \\(a^k\\) and \\(b^k\\) are even for any \\(k\\), and \\(c^k\\) is odd for any \\(k\\).\n     - Therefore, \\(a^k + b^k + c^k\\) is the sum of two even numbers and one odd number, which is always odd.\n     - Hence, \\(v_2(a^k + b^k + c^k) = 0\\) for all \\(k\\). We can choose \\(n = 1\\).\n\n   - **Case 3**: Exactly one of \\(a, b, c\\) is even.\n     - Without loss of generality, assume \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are odd, and \\(c\\) is even.\n     - If \\(k\\) is even, then \\(a^k\\) and \\(b^k\\) are odd, and \\(c^k\\) is even. Thus, \\(a^k + b^k + c^k\\) is the sum of two odd numbers and one even number, which is always even but not divisible by 4.\n     - Therefore, \\(v_2(a^k + b^k + c^k) = 1\\) for all even \\(k\\).\n     - If \\(k\\) is odd, then \\(a^k\\) and \\(b^k\\) are odd, and \\(c^k\\) is even. Thus, \\(a^k + b^k + c^k\\) is the sum of two odd numbers and one even number, which is always even but not divisible by 4.\n     - Therefore, \\(v_2(a^k + b^k + c^k) = 1\\) for all odd \\(k\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: In all cases, the 2-adic valuation \\(v_2(a^k + b^k + c^k)\\) is bounded. Specifically, it is either 0 or 1.

By substituting into the general formula of a geometric sequence, we can find the answer.  \n  \nWhen $n=1$, $a_1=S_1= \\frac{2}{3}a_1+ \\frac{1}{3}$, solving this gives $a_1=1$,  \nFor $n\\geqslant 2$, $a_n=S_n-S_{n-1}=(\\frac{2}{3}a_n+ \\frac{1}{3} )-(\\frac{2}{3}a_{n-1}+ \\frac{1}{3} )=\\frac{2}{3}a_n -\\frac{2}{3}a_{n-1}$,  \nRearranging gives $\\frac{1}{3}a_n =-\\frac{2}{3}a_{n-1}$, i.e., $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}} =-2$,  \nThus, starting from the second term, the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with the first term $-2$ and common ratio $-2$,  \nTherefore, for $n\\geqslant 2$, $a_n=(-2)^{n-1}$,  \nUpon verification, when $n=1$, the above formula also holds,  \nHence, the answer is $(-2)^{n-1}$;  \n$\\boxed{(-2)^{n-1}}$.\n\n(2) **Analysis:**  \nThis question mainly tests the application of the cosine rule, and it is a basic question.  \nThe solution can be directly obtained from the given information and the cosine rule $b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\\cos B$.  \n  \nGiven $a=2$, $B= \\frac{\\pi}{6}$, $c=2 \\sqrt{3}$,  \nBy the cosine rule, $b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\\cos B=4+12-2\u00d72\u00d72 \\sqrt{3} \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6} =4$,  \nSolving this gives $b=2$.  \nTherefore, the answer is $2$.  \n$\\boxed{2}$.\n\n(3) **Analysis:**  \nThis question tests the application of sine and cosine rules, computational skills, and is a basic question.  \nFrom $3\\sin A=5\\sin B$, according to the sine rule, we can get $3a=5b$. Then, using the cosine rule, we can find $C$.  \n  \nSince $3\\sin A=5\\sin B$, by the sine rule, we get $3a=5b$,  \nThus, $a=\\frac{5}{3}b$,  \nSince $b+c=2a$,  \nWe have $c=\\frac{7}{3}b$,  \nThus, $\\cos C=\\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}=- \\frac{1}{2}$.  \nSince $C\\in(0,\\pi)$,  \nWe conclude $C=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.  \nTherefore, the answer is $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.  \n$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$.\n\n(4) **Analysis:**  \nThis question tests the sum formula of a geometric sequence and the solution method of a quadratic inequality, and it is a medium-level question.  \nLet the first term and common ratio of the positive geometric sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ be $a_1$ and $q$, respectively. From the given conditions, we can derive equations about these two quantities. Solving them gives the general formula of the sequence and expressions for $a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n$ and $a_1a_2\\ldots a_n$. Simplifying these expressions yields an inequality about $n$, solving which gives the range of $n$. The upper limit's integer part is the answer.  \n  \nLet the first term and common ratio of the positive geometric sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ be $a_1$ and $q$, respectively.  \nFrom the given conditions, we have $\\begin{cases}a_1q^4= \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ a_1q^5(1+q)=3\\end{cases}$, solving this gives $a_1= \\frac{1}{32}$, $q=2$,  \nThus, the general formula is $a_n= \\frac{1}{32} \u00d72^{n\u22121} =2^{n-6}$.  \nLet $T_n=a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n=\\frac{ \\frac{1}{32}(1-2^n)}{1-2} =\\frac{2^n-1}{2^5}$,  \n$S_n=a_1a_2\\ldots a_n=2^{-5}\u00d72^{-4}\\ldots\u00d72^{n-6}=2^{\\frac{(n-11)n}{2}}$.  \nFrom the given condition, $T_n > S_n$, i.e., $\\frac{2^n-1}{2^5} > 2^{\\frac{1}{2}n^2-\\frac{11}{2}n+5}$,  \nSimplifying gives: $2^n-2^{\\frac{1}{2}n^2-\\frac{11}{2}n+5} > 1$,  \nThus, we need $n > \\frac{1}{2} n^2-\\frac{11}{2} n+5$, i.e., $n^2-13n+10 < 0$  \nSolving this gives $\\frac{13- \\sqrt{129}}{2} < n < \\frac{13+ \\sqrt{129}}{2}$,  \nSince $n$ is a positive integer, the maximum value of $n$ is the integer part of $\\frac{13+ \\sqrt{129}}{2}$, which is $12$.  \nTherefore, the answer is $12$.  \n$\\boxed{12}$.","role":"assistant"}]}

Therefore, $\u2461$ is not a pair of \"equal integral\" functions.\n\nFor $\u2462$, since the graph of $f(x)$ is a semicircle with the origin as the center and $1$ as the radius, $\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1 - x^{2}} dx = \\frac{\u03c0}{2}$. Meanwhile, $\\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) dx = \\frac{1}{4}\u03c0x^{3} |_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{\u03c0}{2}$. Therefore, $\u2462$ is a pair of \"equal integral\" functions.\n\nFor $\u2463$, since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both odd functions defined on $[-1, 1]$ with existing integral values, using the symmetry of the odd function graph about the origin and the geometric meaning of the definite integral, we can find that the definite integrals of the functions $\\int_{-1}^{1} f(x) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) dx = 0$. Therefore, $\u2463$ is a pair of \"equal integral\" functions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C: 3}$.","role":"assistant"}]}

The teacher has $m = \\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ cards, each labeled with a unique number from 1 to $m$. Each student receives one card, and all pairwise sums of these cards leave distinct remainders when divided by $m$. We aim to prove that if $m$ is even, then $n$ must be a perfect square.\n\n2. **Parameter Definitions and Initial Observations:**\n   We number the students from 1 to $n$. Let $a_j$ represent the number on the card received by the $j$th student.

Therefore:\n   - The sum of two odd numbers or two even numbers is even.\n   - The sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.\n\n4. **Counting the Number of Each Type of Sum:**\n   Observing the sums:\n   - The total number of sums $a_i + a_j$ where $i \\neq j$ is $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n   - The sums that will be odd are exactly those where we add an even and an odd number, i.e., $k$ even numbers paired with $n-k$ odd numbers, resulting in $k(n - k)$ odd sums.\n\n5. **Using Given that $m$ is Even:**\n   Since $m = \\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ is even, we have that the number of odd sums is half the total number of sums:\n   \\[\n   2k(n-k) = m = \\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Forming a Quadratic Equation:**\n   Rearranging the equality $2k(n - k) = \\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$:\n   \\[\n   4k(n-k) = n(n-1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4kn - 4k^2 = n^2 - n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4k^2 - 4kn + n^2 - n = 0\n   \\]\n   We get the quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   4k^2 - 4nk + n(n-1) = 0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Recognizing the Properties of the Quadratic Equation:**\n   This can be identified for discriminant analysis. The discriminant $\\Delta$ of this quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (4n)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot n(n-1) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n^2 - 16n(n-1) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n^2 - 16n^2 + 16n \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n \n   \\]\n\n8. **Implicating the Condition for $n$:**\n   We observe:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n \n   \\]\n   which must be a perfect square.

If $n = t^2$ for some integer $t$, then $16t^2 = k^2$ implies $k = 4t$, confirming $n$ must be a perfect square.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\\boxed{n \\text{ is a perfect square}}<\/think>\n\n\n1. **Problem Setup and Known Information:**\n   We start by noting that there are $n \\geq 3$ students in the class. The teacher has $m = \\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ cards, each labeled with a unique number from 1 to $m$. Each student receives one card, and all pairwise sums of these cards leave distinct remainders when divided by $m$. We aim to prove that if $m$ is even, then $n$ must be a perfect square.\n\n2. **Parameter Definitions and Initial Observations:**\n   We number the students from 1 to $n$. Let $a_j$ represent the number on the card received by the $j$th student. Since we are dealing with pairs of students, all pairwise sums $a_i + a_j$ (where $i \\neq j$) produce distinct remainders modulo $m$.\n\n3. **Parity of Cards and Pairwise Sums:**\n   Let's assume that $k$ of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ are even, and the remaining $n - k$ numbers are odd.

The discriminant $\\Delta$ of this quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (4n)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot n(n-1) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n^2 - 16n(n-1) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n^2 - 16n^2 + 16n \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n \n   \\]\n\n8. **Implicating the Condition for $n$:**\n   We observe:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 16n \n   \\]\n   which must be a perfect square.

The possible remainders when any number is divided by \\(n\\) are \\(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\), thus there are \\(n\\) distinct possible remainders.\n\n3. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:**\n\n   Since we have \\(n+1\\) objects but only \\(n\\) possible remainders, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these \\(a_i\\) numbers must have the same remainder when divided by \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Equation Setup and Difference Calculation:**\n\n   Suppose \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\) (where \\(i > j\\)) have the same remainder when divided by \\(n\\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   a_i = nq_i + r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_j = nq_j + r\n   \\]\n   where \\(r\\) is the remainder, and \\(q_i\\), \\(q_j\\) are the quotient integers.\n\n   Their difference is thus:\n   \\[\n   a_i - a_j = (nq_i + r) - (nq_j + r) = n(q_i - q_j)\n   \\]\n   Hence, \\(a_i - a_j\\) is divisible by \\(n\\).\n\n5. **Constructing the Difference:**\n\n   The difference \\(a_i - a_j\\) can be explicitly written with \\(i-j\\) ones followed by \\(j\\) zeros (since \\(a_i = \\underbrace{111 \\ldots 11}_{i \\text{ ones}}\\) and \\(a_j = \\underbrace{111 \\ldots 11}_{j \\text{ ones}}\\)).\n   \\[\n   a_i - a_j = \\underbrace{111 \\ldots 1}_{i \\text{ ones}} - \\underbrace{111 \\ldots 1}_{j \\text{ ones}} = \\underbrace{111 \\ldots 1}_{i-j \\text{ ones}} \\underbrace{000 \\ldots 0}_{j \\text{ zeros}}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The number \\(\\underbrace{111 \\ldots 1}_{i-j \\text{ ones}} \\underbrace{000 \\ldots 0}_{j \\text{ zeros}}\\) is a multiple of \\(n\\) composed of at most \\(n\\) digits, all of which are 0 or 1, thereby satisfying the required conditions.\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{a_i - a_j}\n   \\]\n\n   Hence, for any integer \\(n > 0\\), there exists a non-zero multiple of \\(n\\) with at most \\(n\\) digits, composed only of the digits 0 and 1.","role":"assistant"}]}

The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCO3 + 2 HCl \u2192 CaCl2 + H2O + CO2\n\nHowever, we have two side reactions to consider:\n\n1. The reaction of water (H2O) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form hydronium ion (H3O+) and chloride ion (Cl-):\nH2O + HCl \u2192 H3O+ + Cl-\n\n2. The reaction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) with hydronium ion (H3O+) to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2):\nCaCO3 + 2 H3O+ \u2192 Ca(HCO3)2\n\nGiven that we start with 1 mole of CaCO3 and 2 moles of HCl, let's see how the reactions proceed:\n\nFirst, we need to see if the side reactions will consume any of the HCl before it can react with CaCO3 to form CaCl2. Since we have 2 moles of HCl, and the first side reaction consumes 1 mole of HCl for every mole of H2O, we need to know if there is any H2O present to react with HCl. However, the problem does not mention any initial moles of H2O, so we will assume that all the HCl is available to react with CaCO3.\n\nNow, let's consider the second side reaction. If any H3O+ is formed, it could react with CaCO3 to form Ca(HCO3)2 instead of CaCl2. But since we are not given any initial moles of H3O+ and the problem does not mention the formation of Ca(HCO3)2 as a product, we will assume that all the HCl reacts directly with CaCO3 to form CaCl2.\n\nTherefore, according to the main reaction, 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl to form 1 mole of CaCl2. Since we have 1 mole of CaCO3 and 2 moles of HCl, the reaction will go to completion, and we will form 1 mole of CaCl2.\n\nSo, the moles of CaCl2 formed when 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl, without considering the side reactions, is $\\boxed{1}$  mole.<\/think>\n\nTo determine the moles of CaCl2 formed, we need to look at the main reaction and the side reactions.\n\nThe main reaction is the reaction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form calcium chloride (CaCl2), water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The balanced equation for this reaction is:\n\nCaCO3 + 2 HCl \u2192 CaCl2 + H2O + CO2\n\nHowever, we have two side reactions to consider:\n\n1. The reaction of water (H2O) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form hydronium ion (H3O+) and chloride ion (Cl-):\nH2O + HCl \u2192 H3O+ + Cl-\n\n2. The reaction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) with hydronium ion (H3O+) to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2):\nCaCO3 + 2 H3O+ \u2192 Ca(HCO3)2\n\nGiven that we start with 1 mole of CaCO3 and 2 moles of HCl, let's see how the reactions proceed:\n\nFirst, we need to see if the side reactions will consume any of the HCl before it can react with CaCO3 to form CaCl2. Since we have 2 moles of HCl, and the first side reaction consumes 1 mole of HCl for every mole of H2O, we need to know if there is any H2O present to react with HCl. However, the problem does not mention any initial moles of H2O, so we will assume that all the HCl is available to react with CaCO3.\n\nNow, let's consider the second side reaction. If any H3O+ is formed, it could react with CaCO3 to form Ca(HCO3)2 instead of CaCl2. But since we are not given any initial moles of H3O+ and the problem does not mention the formation of Ca(HCO3)2 as a product, we will assume that all the HCl reacts directly with CaCO3 to form CaCl2.\n\nTherefore, according to the main reaction, 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl to form 1 mole of CaCl2. Since we have 1 mole of CaCO3 and 2 moles of HCl, the reaction will go to completion, and we will form 1 mole of CaCl2.\n\nSo, the moles of CaCl2 formed when 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl, without considering the side reactions, is $\\boxed{1}$  mole.","role":"assistant"}]}

Solving these gives $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ or $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$. \n\nConsidering the range of $\\theta$ that satisfies the initial conditions, we have $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ or $\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Converting these into a common denominator, we get $[0, \\frac{13\\pi}{78}]$ and $[\\frac{26\\pi}{78}, \\frac{39\\pi}{78}]$. \n\nNow, we evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A: $\\frac{3\\pi}{13} = \\frac{18\\pi}{78}$ does not fall within the valid ranges for $\\theta$.\n\n- Option B: $\\frac{5\\pi}{13} = \\frac{30\\pi}{78}$ falls within the valid range $[\\frac{26\\pi}{78}, \\frac{39\\pi}{78}]$.\n\n- Options C and D: Both $\\frac{7\\pi}{13}$ and $\\frac{9\\pi}{13}$ are greater than $\\frac{39\\pi}{78}$ and thus do not satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$.","role":"assistant"}]}

Since $a > b$, it implies $B < A = 45^{\\circ}$.\n2. Applying the Law of Sines to find $\\sin B$:\n   - $\\sin B = \\frac{b\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\sin 45^{\\circ}}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n3. Since $\\frac{2}{3} < 1$, this is possible for the sine of an angle, indicating a unique solution.\n\n**Statement D:**\n\nGiven: $a=7$, $b=7$, $A=75^{\\circ}$.\n\n1. Since $a = b$, it implies $B = A = 75^{\\circ}$.\n2. With $A = B = 75^{\\circ}$, the remaining angle $C$ is:\n   - $C = 180^{\\circ} - A - B = 180^{\\circ} - 75^{\\circ} - 75^{\\circ} = 30^{\\circ}$.\n3. This configuration results in a unique solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements, based on the analysis, are **C** and **D**. Thus, the final answer is encapsulated as $\\boxed{\\text{C and D}}$.","role":"assistant"}]}

So we can set up the following equation:\n\nL * (1 + X\/100) * W * 0.8 = 1.1199999999999999 * L * W\n\nNow we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by L * W:\n\n(1 + X\/100) * 0.8 = 1.1199999999999999\n\nNow we solve for (1 + X\/100):\n\n1 + X\/100 = 1.1199999999999999 \/ 0.8\n\n1 + X\/100 = 1.3999999999999999\n\nNow we subtract 1 from both sides to find X\/100:\n\nX\/100 = 0.3999999999999999\n\nFinally, we multiply by 100 to find X:\n\nX = 0.3999999999999999 * 100\n\nX = 39.99999999999999\n\nSince we're dealing with percentages, we can round this to a reasonable number of significant figures. The gardener increased the length of the garden by approximately $\\boxed{40\\%}$ .","role":"assistant"}]}

There are \\( 10^{18} \\) distinct numbers \\( a + b\\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3} \\) with \\( 0 \\leq a, b, c < 10^6 \\). Divide this interval into \\( 6 \\times 10^{17} \\) equal parts. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two numbers must lie in the same part. Subtracting them:\n   \\[\n   |a_1 + b_1\\sqrt{2} + c_1\\sqrt{3} - (a_2 + b_2\\sqrt{2} + c_2\\sqrt{3})| < \\frac{5 \\times 10^6}{6 \\times 10^{17}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 10^{-11}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n\n   There exist integers \\( a, b, c \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   |a + b\\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3}| < \\frac{5}{6} \\times 10^{-11}\n   \\]\n\nThus, we have shown both parts of the problem:\n\n1. \\( |a + b\\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3}| > 10^{-21} \\)\n2. \\( |a + b\\sqrt{2} + c\\sqrt{3}| < 10^{-11} \\)\n\n\\[ \\boxed{} \\]","role":"assistant"}]}

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one box:\nNumber of boxes = Total volume \/ Volume of one box\nNumber of boxes = 3,060,000 cubic inches \/ 400H cubic inches\n\nNow, we know that the university pays $0.70 for every box and the minimum amount they must spend is $357.

For point $B$: $\\frac{x_{2}^{2}}{16}+\\frac{y_{2}^{2}}{4}=1$\n\nSubtracting these two equations, we get:\n$$\\frac{(x_{1}+x_{2})(x_{1}-x_{2})}{16}+\\frac{(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{1}-y_{2})}{4}=0$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{8}\\cdot (x_{1}-x_{2})+\\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot (y_{1}-y_{2})=0$$\n\nGiven that the midpoint $(\\sqrt{3},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ bisects chord $AB$, we have:\n$$\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}=\\sqrt{3}, \\quad \\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the slope of line $l$ ($k_{AB}$) can be found as follows:\n$$\\sqrt{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot k_{AB}=0 \\implies k_{AB}=-\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the equation of line $l$ is:\n$$y-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=-\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\sqrt{3})$$\nSimplifying this, we get:\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}x+y-\\sqrt{3}=0}$$\n\n#### Part 2: Finding the Area of $\\triangle F_{1}AB$\n\nGiven the equation of line $l$ and the ellipse, we solve the system:\n$$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\sqrt{3}}\\\\{\\frac{x^{2}}{16}+\\frac{y^{2}}{4}=1}\\end{array}\\right.$$\nThis yields the quadratic equation:\n$$x^{2}-2\\sqrt{3}x-2=0$$\n\nFrom this, we find:\n$$x_{1}+x_{2}=2\\sqrt{3}, \\quad x_{1}x_{2}=-2$$\n\nThe length of chord $AB$ is then calculated as:\n$$|AB|=\\sqrt{1+(-\\frac{1}{2})^{2}}\\sqrt{(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{3})^{2}-4\\times(-2)}=5$$\n\nGiven the ellipse's equation, we find the foci distance $c$:\n$$c^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}=16-4=12 \\implies c=2\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nThus, $F_{1}(-2\\sqrt{3}, 0)$.

Given the equation of the ellipse $C$: $\\frac{x^2}{16}+\\frac{y^2}{4}=1$, both points satisfy this equation. Therefore, we have:\n\n1. For point $A$: $\\frac{x_{1}^{2}}{16}+\\frac{y_{1}^{2}}{4}=1$\n2. For point $B$: $\\frac{x_{2}^{2}}{16}+\\frac{y_{2}^{2}}{4}=1$\n\nSubtracting these two equations, we get:\n$$\\frac{(x_{1}+x_{2})(x_{1}-x_{2})}{16}+\\frac{(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{1}-y_{2})}{4}=0$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{8}\\cdot (x_{1}-x_{2})+\\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot (y_{1}-y_{2})=0$$\n\nGiven that the midpoint $(\\sqrt{3},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ bisects chord $AB$, we have:\n$$\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}=\\sqrt{3}, \\quad \\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the slope of line $l$ ($k_{AB}$) can be found as follows:\n$$\\sqrt{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot k_{AB}=0 \\implies k_{AB}=-\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the equation of line $l$ is:\n$$y-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=-\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\sqrt{3})$$\nSimplifying this, we get:\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}x+y-\\sqrt{3}=0}$$\n\n#### Part 2: Finding the Area of $\\triangle F_{1}AB$\n\nGiven the equation of line $l$ and the ellipse, we solve the system:\n$$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\sqrt{3}}\\\\{\\frac{x^{2}}{16}+\\frac{y^{2}}{4}=1}\\end{array}\\right.$$\nThis yields the quadratic equation:\n$$x^{2}-2\\sqrt{3}x-2=0$$\n\nFrom this, we find:\n$$x_{1}+x_{2}=2\\sqrt{3}, \\quad x_{1}x_{2}=-2$$\n\nThe length of chord $AB$ is then calculated as:\n$$|AB|=\\sqrt{1+(-\\frac{1}{2})^{2}}\\sqrt{(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{3})^{2}-4\\times(-2)}=5$$\n\nGiven the ellipse's equation, we find the foci distance $c$:\n$$c^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}=16-4=12 \\implies c=2\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nThus, $F_{1}(-2\\sqrt{3}, 0)$. The distance $d$ from $F_{1}$ to line $l$ is:\n$$d=\\frac{|\\frac{1}{2}\\times(-2\\sqrt{3})+0-\\sqrt{3}|}{\\sqrt{1^{2}+(\\frac{1}{2})^{2}}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{15}}{5}$$\n\nFinally, the area of $\\triangle F_{1}AB$ is:\n$$S_{\\triangle F_{1}AB}=\\frac{1}{2}|AB|d=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\times \\frac{4\\sqrt{15}}{5}=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{15}}$$","role":"assistant"}]}
